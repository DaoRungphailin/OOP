/*Program# 1(Exercise 3.5 p.109Find future dates) 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for
todayâ€™s day of the week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, ..., and Saturday is 6). 
Also prompt the user to enter the number of days after today for a future day 
and displaythe future day of the week. 

Here is a sample run:
Enter today's day: 1 <Enter>
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3 <Enter>
Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday

Enter today's day: 0 <Enter>
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31 <Enter>
Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday*/
